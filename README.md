# Weather project
The weather project displays the weather of any location we have entered; it shows in terms of temperature as well as how the sky looks.  
We have different time frames; the main is the current weather, and we also have a prediction of today's weather with four main times of the day.

## Goal
The purpose of this project is to practice the API call and fetch the data.
