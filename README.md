# Weather project

The weather project displays the weather of any location we have entered, it shows in terms of temperature as well as how the sky looks.  
We have different display; the main is the current weather, and we also have a prediction of today's weather with four main times of the day.

## Goal

The purpose of this project is to practice the API call and incorporate linter and formatter.
